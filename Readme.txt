In this modern world building an website is not very difficult. But personalization of a template is an interesting thing to try.

Here goes my first hosted website, it's a dedication to our baby boo.

What Have I done on top of the template?
------------------

- Installation of node.
- Removal of unnecessary sections and contact section.
- All photos uploaded are shot by me and edited.
- Inclusion of gh-pages for hosting this single page static website.
- Change of JS logic for displaying the dates and time. (Waiting Time Section)
- Entire Icon and favcon packs have been handpicked for baby theme.
- Cusomtized Text and urls added.
